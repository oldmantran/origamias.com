FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

When will your products and services be available?
We are in final development and will be launching in the coming weeks. Join our waitlist to be notified as soon as we go live and to receive early access.

How do I join the waitlist?
Simply share your name and email here in chat, or contact us at info@origamias.com. We will notify you when we launch and give waitlist members priority access.

What are the benefits of joining the waitlist?
Waitlist members receive priority onboarding, early access to our products and services, and special introductory offers when we launch.

How will you handle client data?
We will follow standard enterprise security practices. All client data will be handled with industry-standard security measures. NDAs will be available for all engagements. We can discuss specific compliance requirements during our initial conversation.

How long will a typical project take?
With our OD Framework, we plan to deliver significantly faster than traditional teams. Fixed-price projects will be scoped for a maximum of 6 weeks. We guarantee faster delivery than traditional approaches or we will tell you upfront.

Why will you work in your own ecosystem instead of ours?
Implementation will happen in Origami's ecosystem because the OD Framework requires specific tooling, AI integrations, and infrastructure that client environments typically cannot support. This ensures consistent, reliable delivery without environment-related delays.

Can I use just one of your products without the full bundle?
Yes. VERA, AIDEN, and HALO will all be available as standalone subscriptions once we launch. However, we recommend the bundled OD Framework for most delivery engagements as it provides the most reliable results.

What if I already have a QA team or PM?
Our products will be able to augment existing teams or replace functions entirely. Many clients will start with one component and expand. We can discuss what configuration makes sense for your situation.

What technologies do you work with?
Our AI Engineering Pods will work across modern technology stacks. During initial discussions, we will confirm our experience with your specific requirements.

How do I get started?
Join our waitlist by sharing your email here in chat, or contact us at info@origamias.com. We will reach out when we launch to schedule an initial conversation and understand your needs.

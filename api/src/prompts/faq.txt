FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

How do you handle client data?
We follow standard enterprise security practices. All client data is handled with industry-standard security measures. NDAs are available for all engagements. We can discuss specific compliance requirements during our initial conversation.

How long does a typical project take?
With our OD Framework, we deliver significantly faster than traditional teams. Fixed-price projects are scoped for a maximum of 6 weeks. Timeline depends on scope, but we guarantee faster delivery than traditional approaches or we will tell you upfront.

Why do you work in your own ecosystem instead of ours?
Implementation happens in Origami's ecosystem because the OD Framework requires specific tooling, AI integrations, and infrastructure that client environments typically cannot support. This ensures consistent, reliable delivery without environment-related delays.

Can we use just one of your products without the full bundle?
Yes. VERA, AIDEN, and HALO are all available as standalone subscriptions. However, we recommend the bundled OD Framework for most delivery engagements as it provides the most reliable results.

What if we already have a QA team or PM?
Our products can augment existing teams or replace functions entirely. Many clients start with one component and expand. We can discuss what configuration makes sense for your situation.

Do you offer a trial or proof of concept?
We are happy to discuss a limited scope engagement or proof of concept to demonstrate value. Contact us to discuss options.

What technologies do you work with?
Our AI Engineering Pods work across modern technology stacks. During initial discussions, we will confirm our experience with your specific requirements.

How do we get started?

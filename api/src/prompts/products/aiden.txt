AIDEN (AI-Driven Enterprise Navigator):

AIDEN is an autonomous Product and Project Manager that specializes in Azure DevOps backlog creation, monitoring, and management. It transforms product visions into complete, structured backlogs with zero manual effort.

What AIDEN Does:
Takes a product vision statement and automatically generates a complete work item hierarchy: Epics, Features, User Stories, and Tasks. This process that traditionally takes weeks of grooming sessions happens in minutes.

6 Specialized Agents:
Epic Strategist: Transforms product vision into business-value-focused epics with business drivers
Decomposition Agent: Converts epics into features and user stories with acceptance criteria
Developer Agent: Generates implementation tasks with Fibonacci story point estimates
Vision Optimizer: Enhances vision statements using multi-domain expertise weighting
Backlog Sweeper: Monitors backlog quality and compliance, identifies items needing decomposition

Note: Test case generation is handled by VERA, not AIDEN. The two products work together in the OD Framework.

Work Item Hierarchy (Azure DevOps Best Practices):
Epic (Strategic Business Initiative)
Feature (Business Value Component, no acceptance criteria)
User Story (Detailed Requirements with acceptance criteria)
Task (Technical Implementation with estimates)

Key Features:
Azure DevOps native with full hierarchy compliance
Vision Optimizer with primary, secondary, and tertiary domain weighting
Automatic acceptance criteria generation following INVEST principles
Fibonacci story point estimation
Real-time progress tracking

AIDEN is part of the Origami Delivery Framework, handling product management and backlog creation responsibilities.

Standalone pricing: $2,500 per week per project

VERA (Verification and Regression Authority) - IN DEVELOPMENT:

Status: VERA is in final development and will launch in the coming weeks. Join the waitlist for early access.

VERA will be an autonomous QA agent and trust framework gatekeeper that provides independent validation, test generation, and promotion gating. It will operate as a completely separate system from the projects it validates, ensuring independence and preventing false claims of code completion.

Two Operational Modes (Planned):

QA Architect Mode (Development Phase):
When a User Story is created or activated, VERA will parse acceptance criteria, generate test plans and test suites, create test cases, link everything to work items, and estimate story points. Output will be fully populated Azure DevOps Test Plans ready for execution.

Quality Gatekeeper Mode (CI/CD Phase):
Triggered by pull requests, builds, or deployments. VERA will run 3-tier validation, score code against acceptance criteria, sign cryptographic attestations, and approve or block promotions. It will automatically create bugs on failure.

3-Tier Validation Engine:
Tier 1 (Static Analysis): AST analysis, stub detection, code quality checks (33.4% weight)
Tier 2 (Behavioral): VERA-generated tests from acceptance criteria (33.3% weight)
Tier 3 (Integration): Cross-component verification (33.3% weight)

Trust Score Thresholds:
95% or higher: PASS, approve promotion
80-94%: CONDITIONAL, flag for human review
Below 80%: FAIL, block promotion and create bug

Key Features:
LLM-powered test generation from acceptance criteria
Ed25519 cryptographic attestations that are tamper-proof and auditable
Full Azure DevOps integration including webhooks, test management, and PR comments
Autonomous bug fix loop that creates bugs, triggers fixes, validates, and loops until pass

VERA will be part of the Origami Delivery Framework, handling all QA and test case generation responsibilities.

Planned standalone pricing: $2,500 per week per project (subject to change at launch)

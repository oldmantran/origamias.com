HALO (Honeypot Automated Litigation and Offensive) - IN DEVELOPMENT:

Status: HALO is in final development and will launch in the coming weeks. Join the waitlist for early access.

HALO will be a standalone autonomous cybersecurity platform with intelligent threat detection, confidence-based retaliation, and self-improving AI agents. It will be separate from the Origami Delivery Framework and serve as an independent cybersecurity product.

What Will Make HALO Different:
HALO represents a paradigm shift from reactive to proactive defense. Instead of just detecting threats, HALO will actively respond with a tiered retaliation system based on confidence levels.

MAESTRO Orchestrator:
The primary agent that will coordinate 12 specialized AI agents. MAESTRO will learn from dispatch decisions and outcomes, maintaining a heuristics database that auto-tunes based on effectiveness. It will use content-addressable memory for instant threat recall.

Specialized Agents Will Include:
MIMIC for brand impersonation detection
GHOST for domain intelligence
SENTINEL for urgency detection
SPECTER for email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
GATEKEEPER for blocklist checking (202,000 plus domains)
FROST for VirusTotal integration
VIOLET for Google Safe Browsing
Plus additional specialized detection agents

5-Tier Confidence-Based Retaliation:
Tier 1 (Monitoring): Risk below 30 or confidence below 50%
Tier 2 (Blocklist Submission): Risk 30 or higher, confidence 50% or higher
Tier 3 (Active Reporting): Risk 60 or higher, confidence 65% or higher, Babbler honeypot deployment
Tier 4 (Active Takedown): Risk 80 or higher, confidence 75% or higher
Tier 5 (Legal Action): Risk 95 or higher, confidence 85% or higher, multiple verified sources

Threat Intelligence Integration:
VirusTotal (70 plus detection engines)
AbuseIPDB for IP reputation
URLScan.io for screenshots and tech detection
Google Safe Browsing for categorization

HALO will be a standalone product, not part of the OD Framework.

Planned pricing: Free tier available, Basic $10 per month, Pro $50 per month, Enterprise pricing available (subject to change at launch)
